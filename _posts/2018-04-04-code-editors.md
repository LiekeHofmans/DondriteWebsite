### "What is your favourite code editor?"
This question was asked to me recently. Most likely it wasn't meant too seriously, but it kept nagging me because initially I was having trouble to formulate an answer. The I realised that the reason was that the question assumes that the preference in only person-dependent, whereas instead I think it is person-task-dependent.

So my favourite code editors for the given tasks are:

| Task                                                  | Editor        |
| ----------------------------------------------------  |:-------------:|
| MATLAB                                                | MATLAB editor |
| Web development                                       | Atom          |
| Any small task (windows)                              | Notepad++     |
| Any really small task (unix)                          | vi            |
| Whenever I need to change line endings to unix format | vi            |
| Papers                                                | LaTeX         |
| Python analysis                                       | Spyder        |
| Whenever someone sends me a .doc(x) file              | Word :(       |
| Collaborative text                                    | Google Doc    |
| Never                                                 | Emacs, vim    |
